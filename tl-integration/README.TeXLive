KETCindy for TeX Live
=====================
Layout of the distribution of KETCindy in TeX Live has been adjusted
to follow TDS standards. In addition, a starter script is provided that
checks for correct and up2date installation of the Cinderella plugin 
and the necessary ketcindy.ini file installation.

No further changes to the original sources have been done.
