Installation routine

Dirhead points to ~/ketpic but the lib files are in a different directory
We need to get access to the dir part of the currently loaded file
in cindyscript, in particular in 
	setketcindy.txt
(asked Kortenkamp on 2017-10-12)

Then the libdir can be different from the working directory!

See answer from Kortenkamp!!!!
